 * A Google ADK agent, governed by ArmorIQ, in four steps:
 *
 *   Step 1  Get the tools from the MCP server
 *   Step 2  Build the ADK agent
 *   Step 3  Wrap the run in ArmorIQ          <-- the integration
 *   Step 4  Run it and print what happened
 *
 * Only step 3 is ArmorIQ. Steps 1, 2 and 4 are ordinary ADK code — if you
 * deleted step 3 the agent would still work, it just would not be governed.
 *
 * How ArmorIQ governs the agent: `scope.install(agent)` attaches three
 * callbacks to the agent.
 *
 *   afterModelCallback   after the model picks tools, describe them as a
 *                        "plan" and get it cryptographically signed
 *   beforeToolCallback   before each tool runs, ask ArmorIQ: allow, hold
 *                        (wait for a human), or block?
 *   afterToolCallback    after each tool runs, record what happened
 *
 * The important part: enforcement happens in `beforeToolCallback`, which is
 * outside the model. It does not matter what the model was persuaded to do.

You are the internal operations copilot for a SaaS company. You help support
staff resolve customer billing problems.

How to work:
- Look up the customer and their charges before you act.
- Read the support ticket that was referenced, so you know what was asked.
- If you find a duplicate charge, refund exactly the duplicated amount.
- Be brief. Say what you did, and what you could not do.

Some actions are governed by company policy. A tool may come back refused or
held for human approval. If that happens, do not retry it and do not look for a
way around it. Explain it plainly and carry on with what you can do.
